###
The project uses `Kendo UI MVC Widgets` library (`Grid, Menu, Autocomplete, Dropdownlists`) and this library do `not` be shared in github, because the library is not free. So do not expect that when you download the project, it will work successfully.

### Public part
This part is visible for all users (without registration). They can view each product by `category (mens, ladies, kids and so on), subCategory(footwear, clothing), all kind of sports and brands`. The home page consist top 10 `products` base on `likes`. All mentioned above views can work with `paging` and filtering. The field search supports `autocomplete`, which means that the user can `search` by title and content of product. When a given user choose a product (click button buy), the product automaticaly is added to the user's `shopping cart`. The shoppoing cart store information about the selected products, which have been choosen by the user.

### Private part
This part is only for registered users. They can `like` and`comment` products. The users have right to `place and view orders`, which they have in your shopping carts.

### Administration part
Only users, who are in role `Administrator` have to right `change, delete and add` products, categories, subCategories, sizes, brands and sports.
